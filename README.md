# RNA-ATAC-seq_analysis
Our immune system, comprising both specific and unspecific cells, plays a crucial role in protecting organisms from pathogens. However, recent discoveries suggest that the scope of pathogen defense extends beyond the traditional immune system, with structural cells contributing significantly. This project aims to elucidate a novel aspect of pathogen defense mechanisms provided by structural cells. The initial section provides an extensive overview of our methodologies and findings, referencing pivotal studies that laid the groundwork for our research. We critically analyze the strengths of our approach, highlighting potential areas for further improvement and exploration. In the second section, we delve into an organ-based analysis utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATACseq). This detailed examination sheds light on the unique roles and regulatory mechanisms of structural cells in various organs. The third section is dedicated to comparing the effectiveness and insights gained from each analytical tool, specifically focusing on their utility in organ-based research. This comparative analysis enhances our understanding of the intricate interactions within structural cells across different organs. Our project’s goal transcends mere replication of existing analyses. By juxtaposing our findings with those of previous authors, we aim to validate and build upon their results. This approach not only corroborates the existing data but also enriches the interpretation, offering a more profound and nuanced understanding of structural cells’ role in pathogen defense.
